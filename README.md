## Neural Netwoks

### Image classification on the fashion mnist dataset

The dataset we will use to start is the Fashion MNIST datset. This dataset contains 60000 images of different clothing/apparel items. The goal of our network will be to look at these images and classify them appropriately.

### Text classification on the imdb movie review dataset

The movie_reviews_model.py contains the script for the model which saves it as model.h5. The second python file, movie_review_load_model.py loads the saved model and implements it on a single review on the Lion King (although in the first file we test the model on much more reviews). We predict 1 if the review is 100% positive and 0 if it is 100% negative.

## KNN

This is an implementation of the K nearest neighbors method for classifying cars in 4 categories based upon certain features.

## SVM

Implementing standard SVM method for classifying breast cancer data into malignant or benign based on multiple features.

## K Means Clustering

Implementing K Means Clustering method on the digit dataset.
